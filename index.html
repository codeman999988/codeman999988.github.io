    <h2 class="container" id="why">Why I Love James Randi</h2>
       <p>There are lots of reason to respect, admire, and appreciate the work James has done in his life.  Perhaps it would be best to put some of those reasons into a list.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>He was an <em><strong>Amazing</strong></em> magician.</li>
        <li>He challenged and deligitimised many grifters and charlatans who would use their deceptions to take advantage of people.</li>
        <li>He put his money where his mouth was by issuing a million dollar challenge.  How cool is that?</li>
        <li>He nobly continued his mission well into his old age, and never gave up.</li>
      </ol>
